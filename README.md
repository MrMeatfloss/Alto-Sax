# Alto-Sax

The alto saxophone is in my opinion the most beginner friendly saxophone due to it's versatility and balance. It maintains the general shape and playstyle of a saxophone, while being light and small enough for any player to both carry and play comfortably. This means that kids can both play and carry this saxophone with ease, making it very appealing to elementary students who are playing in concert band. This is why the alto saxophone tends to be the most popular amongst the others when looking at the younger generations
